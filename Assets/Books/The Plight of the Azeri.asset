  Title: The Plight of the Azeri
  Author: Anonymous
  Text: "The third-generation Azeri (the tribe that became the Empire before the
    Second Imperial War) was not a new entity in the history of the empire. It was
    a local tribe led by a man called Othmen, an aristocratic general who had been
    banished from Azeria. Like all other Azeri, he was a rebel who had fallen victim
    to corruption and was exiled without proper legal process. His life ended after
    the Battle of Khaym through an act of vile treason from his fellow generals.
    As the nation gained independence from the Empire, the Azeri government went
    through a protracted civil war.\r\n\r\nThe government of Azeri was dominated
    by a group of aristocratic women, and when the dust settled from the civil conflict,
    its leader Tu-Pian succeeded in creating a system of oligarchs called \"Acer\",
    or government by the general oligarchy. A few months after establishing the Acer
    system, the Azeri people revolted when they saw the opulence of the royal court,
    and their citizens starved. After defeating the Acer, they marched to the royal
    palace gates and burned the houses of the court to ashes.\n\nFollowing the revolt,
    however, the Acer regime quickly collapsed and only a few years later the entire
    Azeri military siezed control. Admiral Huzair was at the helm of the Azeri military,
    still in its infancy but already a formidable army. Their brutal regime came
    with purges and a curtailing of freedoms that made the Acer seem almost benevolent.
    \n\nNotably, the former imperial aide and former vice-premier Commisionar Kair
    was a pivotal figure from the civil war, emerging as a celebrated hero. Yet when
    the military seized control, Kair rose in opposition. In the dead of night, he
    was taken and humiliated in the street for all to see. Dragged from steam-carts
    to the town square, and tortured for a night and day until he eventually moved
    to the next plane. Huzair's brother, Admiral Kuzair Kair, was also indicted in
    the conspiracy, but spared the humiliation of his spouse and quickly executed."
