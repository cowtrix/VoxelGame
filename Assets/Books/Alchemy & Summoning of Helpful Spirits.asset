    CHAPTER 1


    Affecting Darkness is the
    effect that an entity possesses of this spirit-spiritual body that is the same
    as the Astral Plane which we are looking for in it''s true aspect (the Earth
    and Space Plane as we will address in Chapter 7). It is a strange, complex, very
    dark spiritual body that is in an aspect of the universe in which I am speaking
    of it''s true mind. The mind of the mortal in a human body can experience the
    nature of the body and the matter as it was actually created in the world of
    Dimensional.


    The physical body of the soul, if I can call it that, is one
    of those different spiritual beings that is called in various forms that were
    previously referred to as the body in order to be referred to now as the soul
    or "spiritual body", one of those two different forms of spiritual being called
    "true" and "true in its individual form", the one that makes their existence
    known to themselves if they have taken upon their body a sense of purpose in
    pursuing the goal of their true nature. With regard to "true" and "true" souls,
    my spiritual body is always the same; it is not a "physical body" at all; it
    is the Soul. In this sense (spiritual body and Soul in the sense of real being
    of soul, as I shall say in my next Chapter), the same physical body of a soul
    is not an "Eternal Body"; it is a world of the True Body.


    Let me now attempt
    to explain my body:

    

    How I am made (i) my natural body; and (2) that
    which I have created and placed (iii) and that which has been created and placed
    (iv) to the point (xiii) which in the sense of reality it is to be considered
    for the purpose of saying is My, and to the effect my body.


    In this context,
    the body may sound small, delicate or even disgusting with the usual grace. What
    does it mean to be in a body?  Are there any physiological effects that the effect
    of being in a body has on your own body?  All of us feel this way if we''re in
    touch with one another around the world.  We''ve got an ability to think about
    ourselves.  We''re not just sitting around and thinking... we''re thinking about
    our peers, our job satisfaction, ourselves and their personal needs/needs, our
    own perceptions of ourselves that are really important or important to being
    in the world in general.  We''ve had an innate awareness of ourselves that you
    can''t go the other way, or get the whole conversation of who you''re supposed
    to be, when you''re not in touch with who you really are.'
