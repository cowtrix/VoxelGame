  Title: The First Chronicle Of Azerioth
  Author: 'Gooby Pooble '
  Text: "This record is of Azerioth in eir first suncycle of work, perfecting the
    science of Transitentology. Azerioth is a being of the sun, a great warrior and
    craftsman, and he is the only being who can be seen by the sun and not rend eir
    flesh. Azerioth's first work was to create the world of the first suncycle. Azerioth
    was in the process of creating the world of the first suncycle, when he was struck
    by the sun and forever marked by its fire. Azerioth is a star-walker, and the
    first star-walker to be born in the world, and Azerioth was created by Azerioth
    himself.\r\n\r\nFor many years, mortal egos have sought Azerioth for his deep
    and terrible knowledge of this plane and its star-engines. Azerioth was the first
    to discover the secrets of the sun, though some terrible contract keeps such
    secrets encrypted. \r\n\r\nBut what then does Azerioth share with us that warrants
    such diligent recording, dear reader? Well, let me tell you a little story. Couple
    of millenia ago, minding my own business ghostwriting a fairly influential demigod's
    holy text, and who comes strolling into my pocket dimension but Azerioth himself!
    He looks at me and just says \"Do you know who I am?\". Well, I'm busy being
    on fire of course, far too busy to really do anything but scream. And, well,
    the gist of it is that he wanted to hire me to ghostwrite this book about him,
    something about \"getting ahead of a bad media cycle\". \r\n\r\nSo I slaved away
    with little burnt-away nubs on my trans-dimensional typewriter - and let me tell
    you, that thing has a LOT of keys and some of them don't like to stay still.
    And yeah, you know, maybe I miss a deadline or two through the healing process.
    Definitely Azerioth dropping by some notes didn't help, especially as the ancient
    language they were written in made me stab my own eyes out. And yeah, you know,
    maybe I spent a little bit of the deposit on some tasteful art that is before
    its time, and I apologised publicly for that. But the book got done, and then
    that prick didn't pay up. So now I'm releasing it! So enjoy this \"First Chronicle\",
    named so for contractual reasons but unlikely to get a sequel unless that jackass
    learns to sign a cheque anytime soon.\r\n\r\nChapter One\n\n{So I slaved away
